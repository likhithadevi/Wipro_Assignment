Difference between scrum vs Kanban

Scrum and Kanban are both Agile project management methodologies ,but they have some key difference in their approach.Here is a breakdown:

1.Structure:

Scrum:
  Highly structured with defined roles(Product Owner ,Scrum Master ,Developers),events(Sprint Planning ,Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts(Product backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment).




Kanban:
	 Less structured,focusing on continuous workflow with a visual Kanban board displaying tasks in stages(e.g:To Do,In Progress,Done)


2.Planning & Workflows:

Scrum:
    Works in a fixed-length iterations called sprints(typically 1-4 weeks).Teams commit to a set of tasks for each sprint.Work is not interrupted during sprint.
Kanban:
	    Focuses on continuous flow of work.New tasks are added to the board as capacity   allows.Work items move through stages until completion.

3.Focus:

Scrum:
    Focuses on delivering potentially shippable product increments at the end of each sprint.Emphasizes predictability and learning through short cycles.

Kanban: 
    Focuses on optimizing workflow efficiency and lead time for tasks.Emphasizes continuous improvement and flexibility to adapt changing priorities.
