Utilize a subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value, and 
write a UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns.




Select c.customerid,c.customername from customer c
Where c.customerid in (select o.customerid from order o
Where o.ordervalue>(select avg(ordervalue) from order ));



(Select  productid,productname,price from products order by price desc)
Union
(Select productid,productname,price from products order by ask);
