 Create a function that takes a filename as an argument and  prints the number of lines in the file. Call this function LS from your script with different filenames.


#!/bin/bash

count_lines() {
  # Check if file exists
  if [ ! -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "Error: File '$1' does not exist."
    return 1
  fi

  number_of_lines=$(wc -l < "$1")

  echo "$1 has $number_of_lines lines."
}

filenames=("myfile1.txt" "data.csv" "script.sh")
for filename in "${filenames[@]}";
 do
  count_lines "$filename"

Done
