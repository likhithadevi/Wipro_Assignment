Explain the Architecture of Git


Git's Architecture is designed to be efficient, flexible, and handle collaboration efficiently. Here are the two key aspects of its architecture:

Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) :
	Git is Distributed Version Control System, in contrast to other version control system. This indicates that a complete local copy of the repository is owned by every developer. This enables them to efficiently collaborate even when working offline.



Three-Stage Architecture:
	Git uses a three-stage workflow for managing changes:

1.Working Directory:
	This is your local folder structure or working directory , where you perform codebase modifications.
2.Staging Area:
	This is a makeshift holding area where you specifically stage the files you wish to include in your next commit.
3.Repository:
	This is the main database where all of your project 's history  including all of the codebase snapshots that have been committed is kept.


	
Objects:
	Internally, Git stores information as different types of objects:

1.Blobs:
	Represents the raw contents of files.
2.Trees:
	Arrange blobs according to your directory structure in a hierarchical manner.
3.Commits:
	Provide information on the author and commit message, as well as a reference to tree snapshot. They also establish a history by linking to parent commits.
4.Tags:
	Serve as named references to particular commits; they are helpful for identifying significant versions.


Branching and Merging:
	A powerful feature of Git is branching. In order to work on new features or problem fixes, developers can do this by creating isolated working directories from the main source. They can merge the changes back into main branch after they 've finished their job.


This  architecture offers several advantages:

Offline Work:
	Without an internet connection, developers can continue working on improvements.
Data Integrity:
	Git uses checksums to ensure that all data is accurate.
Effective History Tracking:
	Git keeps the project 's change history with the least amount of redundancy possible.
Flexibility in Branching:
	Branching facilitates autonomous development and seamless incorporation of modifications.

Overall , Git is a popular option for software development projects because of its architecture, which offers a strong foundation for collaborative version management.
