 Produce a comparative infographic of TDD, BDD, and FDD methodologies. Illustrate their unique approaches, benefits, and suitability for different software development contexts. Use visuals to enhance understanding.


1.Test Driven Development 

* Focus: Writing automated tests before writing code
* Process:
1. Identify a feature  to develop
2. Write a failing test for the feature
3. Write minimal code to make the test pass
4. Refactor the code for maintainability
5. Repeat for all features
* Benefits:
      1.Reduced bugs
       2.Improved code quality
      3.Enhanced design
      4.Increased maintainability
* Suitable for: Projects with clear requirements ,unit-testable code



2.Behaviour Driven Development

Focus: Collaboration between developers, testers, and stakeholders using clear, shared language(gherkin syntax).
Process:
        1.Define user stories and acceptance criteria in a collaborative environment.
        2.Translate user stories into executable specifications(gherkin features)
        3.Develop code that fulfills the acceptance criteria.
        4.Continuously refine features based on feedback.
Benefits:
        1.Improved communication and collaboration
        2.Clearer understanding of user needs.
        3.Early bug detection
        4.Increased stakeholder satisfaction.
Suitable for: Projects with complex requirements, heavy user interactions


3.Feature Driven Development:

Focus: Breaking down projects into small, manageable features with clearly defined objectives are deliverables.
Process:
   1.Develop a project model outlining features and dependencies.
   2.Conduct iterative planning sessions for each feature
   3.Develop,design and implement each feature in a short timeframe
 4.Conduct quality reviews after each iteration.


Benefits:
* Increased project control and predictability
* Improved risk management
* Efficient resource allocation
* Early delivery of working features


Suitable for: Large, complex projects with evolving requirements.
