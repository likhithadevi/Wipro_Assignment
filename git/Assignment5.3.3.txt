Explain absolute and relative path?

    	Absolute and relative paths are two ways to specify the location of a file or directory within a computer's file system. Here’s a breakdown of the key differences:

1.Absolute Path:

	Definition:
   		An absolute path specifies the exact location of a file or directory starting from the root directory(usually denoted by “/” on Unix-based systems and drive letters like “C:” on windows)

      Example:
	     /home/rps/Desktop/demo.txt


     Advantages:
	1.Clear and unambiguous, easy to understand where the file resides
	2.Works regardless of your current working directory

     Disadvantages:
         1.Can be lengthy and inconvenient to type ,especially for deeply nested locations.
	 2.Not portable


2.Relative Path:

	Definition:
   	       A relative path specifies the location of a file or directory relative to your current working directory .It doesn’t involve the entire path from the root.

	Example:
  		 cd Desktop

	
	Advantages:
               
 	    1.More concise and easier to type, especially for frequently accessed files/directories    within your current location 
     	    2.More Portable.


	Disadvantages:
      
     	    1.Relies on your current working directory. The same relative path might point to different locations depending on where you are in the file system.
